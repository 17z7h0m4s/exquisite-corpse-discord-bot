# Exquisite Corpse

A Discord bot for the Surrealist poetry game.

> "The only hard and fast rule of Exquisite Corpse is that each participant is unaware of what the others have written, thus producing a surprising—sometimes absurd—yet often beautiful poem."

The game traces its roots to 1920s Paris, where the Surrealists invented a technique for bypassing conscious thought and tapping into collective imagination. The name comes from the first poem created this way: *"Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau"* — "The exquisite corpse will drink the young wine."

This bot adapts the paper-folding mechanic for Discord. Two players alternate writing six words at a time, but each sees only the final word of their partner's contribution. The collision produces lines neither could have written alone.
